<!-- the p element explaining about strings on how they're written with quotes and that I can use either single quotes or double quotes -->
<p>Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:</p>

<!-- the p element that has only an id called demo -->
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

// the carName1 variable (declared by the let keyword) that is assigned a string value wrapped in double quotes that says "Volvo XC60"
let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";

// the carName2 variable (declared by the let keyword) being assigned the same string value in single quotes this time which does say 'Volvo XC60'
let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';

// the particular line of code inside of the opening and closing script tags that's telling the browser of this document/webpage to print out each of the carName1 and carName2 variables including a br tag that make a break in between of these variables of their string value that are being put together by the + operator of 2 of them which make a new string that'll be printed out into the HTML element being the p element containing an id called demo
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
carName1 + "<br>" + 
carName2;
