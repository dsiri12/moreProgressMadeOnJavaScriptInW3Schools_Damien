<h2>JavaScript Booleans</h2>

<!-- the p element that briefly explains about booleans on how they can have 2 values of either true or false -->
<p>Booleans can have two values: true or false:</p>

<!-- the p element containing only an id called demo -->
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

// the x variable (declared by the let keyword) that has a stored value of 5
let x = 5;

// the y variable (declared by the let keyword) having a stored value of 5 inside of this specific y variable
let y = 5;

// the z variable (declared by the let keyword) that has a value of 6 stored inside of this specific z variable
let z = 6;

// the particular line of code that's inside of the opening and closing script tags that's telling the browser of this current document/webpage to print out each of the booleans in their own parentheses of (x == y) and (x == z) including a br tag that is making a break in between each of these 2 different booleans that are all being put together by the 2 + operators into a new string that'll be printed out into the HTML element being the p element containing an id called demo
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
(x == y) + "<br>" + (x == z);
