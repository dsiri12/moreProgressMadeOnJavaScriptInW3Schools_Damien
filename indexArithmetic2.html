<h2>JavaScript Arithmetic</h2>

<!-- the p element that explains what was explained about in the previous webpage before this new webpage on a typical arithmetic operation of how it takes 2 of the numbers and then produces a result right after of what is mostly done the same for variables also -->
<p>A typical arithmetic operation takes two numbers (or variables) and produces a new number.</p>

<!-- the p element that contains only an id called demo and nothing else that was contained inside of this element in specific -->
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

// the a variable (declared by the let keyword) that has a stored value of 100 inside of there
let a = 100;

// the b variable (declared by the let keyword) having a value of 50 stored in this specific variable
let b = 50;

// the x variable (declared by the let keyword) that is assigned a typical arithmetic operation where the a and b variables of their values that are being added to eachother by the + operator
let x = a + b;

// the particular line of code that is telling the browser of this document/webpage to output the x variable into the HTML element being mainly the p element containg an id called demo
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
