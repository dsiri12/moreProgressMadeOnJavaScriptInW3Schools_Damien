<!-- the p element that explains about how expressions are evaluated from left to right by JavaScript and how different sequences of any sort can produce different results of their own -->
<p>JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results:</p>

<!-- the p element containing an id called demo only -->
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

// the x variable (declared by the let keyword) that is assigned an expression of the operands 16 and 4 including a string value called "Volvo" and where this particular expression can produce any result of any sort right after with where the operands 16 and 4 are treated as numbers by JavaScript before the string value of "Volvo" is reached in this expression in particular
let x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo";

// the particular line of code inside of the opening and closing script tags that's telling the browser of this current document/webpage to output the x variable of it's own value into the HTML element being the p element containing an id called demo
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
