<p>JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:</p>

<!-- the p element containing only an id called demo -->
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

// the x variable (declared by the let keyword) without any value that was stored inside of this specific x variable and where a single-line comment is on the right side and below this single-line comment that says how the x variable is undefined
let x;         // Now x is undefined

// the x variable that isn't declared by any keyword of any sort that is assigned the number 5 and where a single-line comment says that the x variable is a number
x = 5;         // Now x is a Number

// the x variable without any keyword to declare this specific x variable that is assigned a string value of "John" and where a single-line comment says that the x variable is a string
x = "John";    // Now x is a String

// the particular line of code inside of the opening and closing script tags that's telling the browser of this specific document/webpage to output the x variable of it's own value into the HTML element being the p element containing an id called demo
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
