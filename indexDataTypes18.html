// the car variable (declared by the let keyword) that is assigned a string value wrapped in double quotes that has nothing inside of there of which would be both legal and a type in this particular case here
let car = "";

// the particular line of code that's inside of the opening and closing script tags that is telling the browser of this document/webpage to print out the 2 string values wrapped in double quotes including the car variable of it's own value being both legal and a type and the typeof operator that is returning the car variable of a variable that is both legal and a type while also a br tag that is wrapped in double quotes that is making a break in between the car variable of it's own value and the string value wrapped in double quotes that says "The type is: " that are all being put together by the 4 + operators into a new string that'll be printed out into the HTML element being the p element containing an id called demo
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The value is: " + car + "<br>" + "The type is: " + typeof car;
