// the a variable (declared by the let keyword) that has a stored value of 3 in this specific variable
let a = 3;

// the x variable (declared by the let keyword) that is assigned a typical arithmetic operation of where 100 and 50 including the + operator are each inside of the parentheses that are being added to eachother and how right after of where the a variable of it's value is being multiplied by the * operator to the sum of 100 and 50
let x = (100 + 50) * a;

// the particular line of code that is telling the browser of this current document/webpage to output the x variable of it's own value into the HTML element being the p element containing an id called demo
